# Capstone
## Data Set Ideas
1.) Cornea Donor Study
https://public.jaeb.org/cds/view/home

This is a really cool study about people who had cornea transplants and their donors. It follows up with the patients at 5 and 10 years to see if they had any complications or graft failures. There's a lot of interesting information about the donor (age, gender, tissue quality, cause of death, hours from death to preservation, etc.). BUT I don't know how I could incorporate material from Phase 4. This seems more like a linear regression problem and may not be suitable for a capstone.

1.5) Along those same lines....Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network 
https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/data/view-data-reports/national-data/

This site has a lot of interesting data about different kinds of organ transplant donors/recipients nationwide. I found this at the beginning of the bootcamp and saved it as my go-to capstone data set. However, once I looked at it more, I think it's more data reports than a database. I could maybe(?) scrape enough data to make a useful data set out of it, but I think I'd be in the same position as I am with data set #1--not sure what ML I can do with it.

2.) 200,000+ Jeopardy! Questions https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/

Randomly came across this data set and found it intriguing. It'd be fun to work with it as if I'm helping someone who's going to be on Jeopardy prepare for the most common topics/questions/etc. But once again, I'm not sure this is capstone-worthy.

3.) Game of Thrones Season 8â€“Twitter https://www.kaggle.com/monogenea/game-of-thrones-twitter

This is a dataset of tweets during the final season of Game of Thrones. I could do sentiment analysis on it to see how fans reacted to it episode by episode, as well as possibly look at sentiment analysis at the character-level.
